Well, a new year has arrived, and that makes this an appropriate time to reflect on what really mattered about the past year: the books we read.

# The Plan

The year started off a bit strangely with the untimely death of my harddrive. One side effect of this was the loss of records of the first week or two of January,
including the books I was reading. We mourn their loss (or rather, the loss of information, I'm still not sure what was finished November-December 2019, and what was
finished January 2020).

After 2019's "Year of Reading Dangerously" went rather well, I decided not to make use of a specific reading list or reading challenge (in previous years, I've
attempted and finished PopSugar's Reading Challenge, but not this time). Instead of a 'Challenge', 2020 had a 'Theme'. The overall goal, then, was to read more books
written by POC, particular BIPOC and particularly women of colour. The purpose of a theme is not to restrict, but rather to encourage more reading of a certain type.
Without having measured the diversity of authors read in past years, however, it becomes difficult to assess whether there has been an increase made. Perhaps a project
for a future time?
