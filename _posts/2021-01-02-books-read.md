Note: This is a test post, created in the process of figuring out the blogging aspects of the site. It may be incomplete and/or sarcastic.

Well, a new year has arrived, and that makes this an appropriate time to reflect on what really mattered about the past year: the books we read.

# The Plan

The year started off a bit strangely with the untimely death of my harddrive. One side effect of this was the loss of records of the first week or two of January,
including the books I was reading. We mourn their loss (or rather, the loss of information, I'm still not sure what was finished November-December 2019, and what was
finished January 2020).

### The Lost Books:
- Accidental Time Machine
- Empire of the SUn
- Arabian Nights
- Door into Ocean
- The Fifth Season
- The Moon is a Harsh Mistress
- Austerlitz
- All This has Nothing to Do with Me
- The Marrow Thieves
- Nova Express
- Bird Box
- Battle Royale
- The Zombie Survival Guide
- The Terminal Experiment
- Anansi the Spider
- Tao Te Ching
- Yokohama Kaidaishi Kikon
- Harrison Bergeron
- The Year of the Flood
- Duped
- The Bone Clocks
- Death Note (Volume 2)
- Warm Bodies
- The Builders
- Delirium
- The Last Unicorn
- Outlaw School
- Speedboat
- Omon Ra

## The Year's Theme

After 2019's "Year of Reading Dangerously" went rather well, I decided not to make use of a specific reading list or reading challenge (in previous years, I've
attempted and finished PopSugar's Reading Challenge, but not this time). Instead of a 'Challenge', 2020 had a 'Theme'. The overall goal, then, was to read more books
written by POC, particular BIPOC and particularly women of colour. The purpose of a theme is not to restrict, but rather to encourage more reading of a certain type.
Without having measured the diversity of authors read in past years, however, it becomes difficult to assess whether there has been an increase made. Perhaps a project
for a future time?

# The Best and the Worst

## The Best Five Books

(Where "best" is defined as most engaging, interesting, thought-provoking, and/or emotionally impactful. Strong points for books I couldn't stop thinking about, and
books where reading it makes me want to read more written by the same person or on the same subject.)

In no particular order:

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

## The Worst Five Books

(Where "worst" is defined primarily as most disappointing and/or problematic. These are not so much random things I picked up that happened to not work for me, but rather books I was excited for that didn't meet expectations, or ones that were good at first, but fizzled out. Surprise racism/sexism/general-"wtf were you thinking" 
can also contribute to placement here.)

In no particular order:

1. The eye of the world

2. the stolen lake

3. Horns

4. The Testaments

5. the beach

# Reflection

What worked this year? What didn't? What do I want to do more of going forward? Less of? How did my experience of reading change over the course of the year?

What's next year's theme going to be?
