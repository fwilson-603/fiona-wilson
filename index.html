	<p>I'm currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Toronto. My thesis project is focused on negation in Cree 
		languages, especially the Muskeg Cree dialect (a.k.a. Swampy Cree) and the Plains Cree dialect.</p>
	<p>This website is very much a work in progress, so there's not much to see right now! But you can contact me at the email link below.</p>
